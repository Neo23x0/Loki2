# LOKI2
LOKI - Simple IOC and YARA Scanner

## Status

Work in Progress. This version is not ready for use. There's still some work to do for a first release. 

### What's already implemented

- System reconnaissance (system and hardware information for the log)
- Logging and formatting of the different log outputs
- File system walk
- File time evaluation (MAC timestamps)
- Exclusions based on file characteristics
- IOC initialization - hash values
- IOC matching on files (hashes)
- YARA rule initialization, syntax checks, and error handling
- YARA scanning of files
- YARA scanning of process memory 

### What's still to do

- IOC initialization - file patterns
- IOC initialization - C2 patterns (FQDN, IP)
- IOC matching on files (file patterns)
- C2 IOC matching (process connections)
- File system walk exceptions: network drivers, mounted drives etc.
- Custom exclusions (regex on file path)
- Release workflows (automatically build and provide as release)
